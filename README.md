- 👋 Hi, I'm Ryan
- 👀 I’m interested in data analysis in health care and human services to create better decision making for vulnerable and marginalised populations, especially in humanitarian settings and in emergency management, as I am a current Red Cross Emergency Management volunteer.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python and SQL through Coursera!
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate with anyone who has similar goals to myself.
- 📫 How to reach me: ryan.w.hill@gmail.com
